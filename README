This small project is a fork of the following gist code:

http://gist.github.com/11652

It supplies a class to perform file upload using the Cappuccino framework:

http://cappuccino.org/

It also includes a small sample application that, along with the appropriate
Cappuccino Frameworks directory, will demonstrate the use of the File Upload
button.

*Copyright/License*

Any changes made to FileUpload.j after the initial commit in this repository
are released to the public domain.  For information about copyright/licensing
for the bulk of the code in FileUpload.j you must refer to the original gist
link noted at the head of this file and to the original copyright statement in
FileUpload.j.

*Running the Sample Application*

Some kind of web-server must be used to both serve the sample application and
receive the POST event once a file is selected.  The domain name for both the
files served and the POST must be identical or the code will not work correctly
(iframe cross-domain issues are encountered and the response from the POST
cannot be read by the FileUpload code).

The current sample application will post back to the /file_upload directory on
the same server used to server the application.  Change the setURL call in
AppController.j if you need to post to a different directory.
